The need for this volume has become apparent in recent years as we experience technological revolutions in the fabric of the everyday, a paradigm shift similar to the one that brought readers to the Gernsback publications a century ago.  The ability of Gernsback's ideas to speak to us today can be seen in the ways that images from his magazines circulate online through a wide variety of blogs and social image sharing sites.  Gernsback's life and works are now beginning to receive a more formal treatment, with two major museum exhibits recently held, one at Luxembourg's [National Center for Literature](http://www.cnl.public.lu/agenda/2011/5/Expo_Hugo_Gernsback/index.html?highlight=gernsback) in 2011, and another in 2013 at the [ZKM (Center for Art and Media Technology)](http://on1.zkm.de/zkm/stories/storyReader$8492) in Karlsruhe, Germany.^[A video of this exhibit can be seen at <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEq6Mlu9j8I>]  In addition, the visual artist Eric Schockmel is currently making an animated documentary film about Gernsback.

In these publications, one could find a literary treatise on what the genre of "scientifiction" should look like alongside blueprints for a homebrewed television receiver well before its commercial possibility.  *Electrical Experimenter* and *Modern Electrics* published profiles of new technologies used in cinema production and projection (a medium itself in its infancy), commenting once those films were released on the depiction of new and often imaginary devices used by the characters on screen.  Long before Gernsback founded *Amazing Stories,* these magazines used speculative fiction to find a language suited to the analysis of emerging media like radio, television, or the more exotic osophone and telegraphone.

The book will be organized chronologically in order to highlight the conceptual fluidity of these writings that moved with ease from literature to technology.  I will, however, make available a thematic table of contents and organize my introduction around the following five areas:

* Tinkering: reports on broadcast experiments at Gernsback's WRNY radio station, new inventions developed at the Electro Importing Company labs, and critical essays on techniques for thinking creatively through technology
* Scientifiction: foundational writings on science fiction as a distinct genre, including literary historical essays on writers Gernsback understood to be predecessors: Wells, Verne, Poe, Luis Senarens, Clement Fezandi√©
* Media History: later works that read current inventions in light of their not so distant precursors, profiling forgotten (and often quirky) paths not taken in the development of radio and television
* Broadcast Regulation: activism, community organization, and manifestos written in service of radio amateur rights after the US government banned all public wireless activities in the wake of World War I; includes later writings for the technocracy movement
* Selected Fiction: four short stories and the original serialized version of the famous *Ralph 124C 41+*, all of which have been out of print since their original magazine publication
