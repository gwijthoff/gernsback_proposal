# Introduction 

In the April 1911 issue of editor Hugo Gernsback’s *Modern Electrics*, a fifteen-year-old Lewis Mumford published his first piece of writing in the magazine’s "Experimental Department," a place for readers’ home-brewed designs for novel electrical devices. Best known for the magisterial history of technology *Technics and Civilization* (1934), the young Mumford describes here his portable wireless telegraph receiver: "smaller than a small camera, in which sensitiveness is not sacrificed to saving of space." Flipping back three pages in the same issue, one can find the first installment of Gernsback’s serial novel *Ralph 124C 41+: A Romance of the Year 2660*, one of the earliest works of modern science fiction. [@mumford_portable_1911]

The proximity of this future media theorist’s first published piece of writing to one of the foundational works of science fiction is no coincidence. Mumford’s early preoccupation as a tinkerer took root in a forum for the exchange of designs, components, and visions of the future. Mumford, who would go on to have a successful career as, among many other things, a literary critic and associate editor of *The Dial*, later cites these experiences among a community of tinkerers in the pages of *Modern Electrics* as foundational for his later theories of what he called technology's "spiritual contribution to our culture."^[@mumford_technics_1963]

Gernsback’s *Modern Electrics* began as a mail-order catalogue for imported wireless parts and exotic electrical miscellany in 1905, gradually evolving into a fleet of popular and specialist magazines, including *Electrical Experimenter, Radio News, Science & Invention*, and the *Technocracy Review*.  Though Hugo Gernsback is best remembered today for launching the first science fiction magazine, *Amazing Stories* (1926), and the Hugo Award is given out each year to the best works in the genre, he now receives little more than a one- to two-sentence nod in science fiction studies. He is associated with the gaudy covers of his magazines and a "crude and heavy-handed" editorial style that perpetuated many of the negative stereotypes still associated with science fiction today. Much of this attitude has been inherited from a generation of science fiction scholars who were not academics but editors themselves, and disparaged Gernsback’s editorial practices as well as the infamously low wages he paid his writers. But this inherited version focuses only on the period from *Amazing Stories* and after, entirely overlooking the context of the genre’s birth in Gernsback’s experimenter magazines, as well as his work as a pioneer in media technologies and broadcasting techniques.

Titled after an essay of his on the influence that objects exert on thought, *The Perversity of Things: Writings on Media, Technology, and Science Fiction* makes available texts by Gernsback that were foundational for both science fiction and the emergence of media studies.  These editorials, speculative blueprints, literary critical essays, and media histories have been out of print since their original publication in Gernsback's magazines from 1905-1933.  Together, they show how his publications evolved from an electrical parts catalog into a fully-fledged literary genre, an altogether untold story in American literary and media history.  As the curator of a (recent exhibit)[http://on1.zkm.de/zkm/stories/storyReader%248492] on Gernsback at the ZKM (Center for Art and Media Technology), Franz Pichler writes, "Hugo Gernsback is the father of American electronic culture."^[@pichler_hugo_2013]  With his monthly editorials, feature articles, and short fiction, Gernsback pioneered a kind of writing that combined hard technical description with an openness to the fantastic. It was a mixture out of which an entire literary genre emerged to tackle the question of the distinctive specificity of "medium" in a new wireless age in the opening decades of the twentieth century.  *The Perversity of Things* will show that science fiction emerged in the United States as a discourse on media.

# Background 

## Gernsback’s biography 

Born Hugo Gernsbacher in Luxembourg in 1884, the son of a successful wine wholesaler, Gernsback immigrated to the United States in 1904 at the age of 19. Carrying with him the design for a new kind of dry cell battery, Gernsback published his first article on the device a year later in *Scientific American* under that most American of names, "Huck." Gernsback sold the battery patent to the Packard Motor Car Company, who ended up using technology in their ignition systems.  With the profits of his sale, Gernsback formed the Electro Importing Company, an importer of specialized electrical equipment from Europe and the first mail-order radio house in the country. Through their catalog and retail store at 84 West Broadway in New York, the company provided access to specialized wireless and electrical equipment not found anywhere outside of Europe. Electro Importing catered to a diverse clientele, providing their more advanced basement experimenters with the first vacuum tube offered for sale to the general public in 1911, and manufacturing for their novice users in 1905 the first ever fully assembled radio set commercially available in the United States, the Telimco.

![Electro Importing Company store, c. 1908](imgaes/eico_store.png)

After several issues of their mail order catalog and a growing subscription list, Electro Importing began including features, editorials, and letters to the editor. Between 1906 and 1910, the catalog grew into a series of monthly magazines for the wireless homebrewer, beginning with *Modern Electrics* in 1908 and the offshoot Experimenter Publishing Company in 1915. While *Modern Electrics* still advertised the equipment Electro Importing offered for sale in a familiar grid layout with ordering instructions, it also included feature articles detailing the latest research into experimental media technologies in America, Germany, France, and in Gernsback’s own company offices. Regular reporters and celebrity guest contributors like Lee De Forest, Thomas Edison, and Nikola Tesla^[Tesla first published his autobiography in serial installments in *Electrical Experimenter,* a book that was recently rereleased by Penguin Classics. @tesla_my_2011] provided reports on television, wireless telephony, and the use of novel electrical apparatuses in film and theatrical productions, each of which would go into a great degree of technical detail.

But the hallmark of the magazine became its more speculative articles, those that were willing to extrapolate fantastic scenarios out of the technical details at hand. In "Signaling to Mars," Gernsback detailed the conditions that would have to obtain in order for Earth to send messages via wireless telegraph to the red planet. For readers of *Modern Electrics*, the technical context in which this highly speculative article appeared only led credence to the idea that contact with an alien civilization was right around the corner. In the copy of this issue at Princeton University’s Firestone Library, someone inserted a newspaper clipping (now a permanently affixed leaf within the bound volume) that tells of a new distance record for wireless signaling, from San Francisco to the Pacific Mail Line steamship Korea as it made its way across the ocean. Left there as if to vouch for the plausibility of the idea that we’ll soon be able to connect with our nearest planetary neighbor, the clipping provides a wonderful sense of how it was people read these magazines. Though the Gernsback titles eventually became infamous for their sometimes outlandish claims – that electric current might clean us better than water; that the success of a marriage can be predicted using gadgets assembled out of various household supplies – they were always presented through a lens of supposedly scientific rationality. This frame affected the reception of the magazines by their readers, the design ethos that grew up around them, and the kind of fiction they eventually produced.

The shape of media to come took on an iconography all its own through the illustrations of Frank R. Paul. Paul’s depictions of gadgetry circulated widely beyond their original publication venues in a way that has never before been given any attention. Plans for the osophon, a device Gernsback designed to replace headphones by transmitting sound through vibrations in the jawbone of the listener, were published and reviewed in the German journal *Der Radio-Amateur*.^[@nesper_osophon_1924] Paul’s sketch of a man using a tuning fork to calibrate the speed of the 1928 *Science and Invention* Nipkow disk television receiver was republished the following year in the Chinese film journal *Yingxi zazhi* (*Shadow Play Magazine*) as an illustration of recent research into television, what was referred to in the article as, directly translated, "wireless cinema."^[@bao_sympathetic_2011. Bao located Paul’s illustration of the *Science and Invention* television receiver in @shen_xiaose__dianyingjie_1929. The term for television used in this article is "wuxian dianying (wireless cinema, or, more literally, wireless electric shadow, or radio shadow)." Paul’s images were originally published in @_radio_1928.]  Paul's images, now in the public domain, accompanied Gernsback's writings and will form an important part of this collection as well.

![*Science and Invention* illustrations republished in Chinese film journal *Yingxi Zazhi*](images/shadow_play_mag.jpg)

The incredibly rich context of the science fiction's birth in Gernsback's fleet of technical publications for the amateur experimenter, as well as his work as a pioneer in media technologies and broadcasting techniques, have been entirely overlooked.  In his illustrated magazines and compendiums of amateur designs, one could find a literary treatise on what the genre of "scientifiction" should look like alongside blueprints for a homebrewed television receiver well before its commercial possibility.  Gernsback's translation of an influential German handbook titled *The Practical Electrician* ran next to a speculative article on what it would take to provide a global system of free electricity powered by ocean currents.  Long before Gernsback founded *Amazing Stories,* these magazines used speculative fiction to find a language suited to the analysis of emerging media like radio, television, or the more exotic osophone and telegraphone.

*The Perversity of Things* thus seeks to provide a reappraisal of both the "hard" technical roots of American science fiction and the highly speculative orientation toward media technologies during this period.  Science fiction in its early days wasn't just a literary form, it was a mode of interacting with new media.  The literary historical gambit of this book is to recover the radical sense of openness that greeted not only the basement tinkerer working through the feasibility of transmitting images over a wire, but also the author of "scientifiction" stories who possessed a highly sophisticated awareness of the fact that "Two hundred years ago, stories of this kind were not possible."  Often, these individuals were one and the same, weaving together functional and fictional devices in a manner that served for them as a form of scientific discovery in itself.

## Gernsback’s reputation in the critical literature

Hugo Gernsback has been given very little attention in science fiction studies, with the field's leading critics often assuming that *Amazing Stories* was little more than a marketing gimmick for Gernsback’s technical ventures.  The fiction published in the pages of his magazines is often seen to have very little aesthetic or literary value.  So when Gernsback is given credit in the foundation of modern American SF, it is as a kind of marketer of a new brand name, rather than a writer or editor.  As Alexi and Cory Panshin write, "In the pages of *Amazing*, SF literature at last became identified by a single name: ’scientifiction.’ It was provided with a history. It was defined and demonstrated. It was consolidated and unified. In *Amazing*, SF became conscious of itself."[@panshin_world_1989, 170.]  According to John Clute and Peter Nicholls, Gernsback "gave the genre a local habitation and a name," and for James Gunn, he "provided a focus for enthusiasm, for publication, for development," and bestowed science fiction with its "characteristic content, a characteristic form, and characteristic purposes."[@clute_encyclopedia_1995, 491. @gunn_alternate_1975, 128.] 

These critical histories (each of which are written by SF novelists in their own right) proceed as if propelled by their own fantastic, alternate history: what if science fiction left us with texts as highly valued as the works of modernism from the very beginning? No doubt the field of science fiction studies has done a great deal of work in order to elevate certain works of the genre (mainly from the 1960s and 70s New Wave) to a kind of academic respectability. But these assumptions about the genre’s magazine era beginnings have never been questioned, nor have any of Gernsback’s publications save for *Amazing Stories* been submitted to any kind of rigorous analysis. The editorial function many SF histories begrudgingly ascribe to Gernsback overlooks the much more interesting heritage of magazine SF within a wider tradition of thinking about new media.

# Recent books and exhibits

Though this story has held sway over the reception of Gernsback until very recently. A number of books and museum exhibits are beginning to rethink Gernsback’s role in media history, and the origins of science fiction more broadly.

Craig Yoe’s *The Best of Sexology: Kinky and Kooky Excerpts from America’s First Sex Magazine* (Running Press, 2008) is an anthology of articles from one of Gernsback’s more adventurous titles, *Sexology*. Unfortunately, the volume does little more than reproduce page scans of articles from the magazine, treating them as retro-kitsch curiosities that deserve no further contextualization or detail.

# Outline of Book 

My introduction to this volume will situate Gernsback’s essays within their technological and media historical contexts.  The book will then be organized chronologically in order to highlight the conceptual fluidity of Gernsback's writings and allow readers to experience the interdisciplinary soup out of which his thinking emerged.  For instance, one essay covers the chemical properties of selenium as a substrate for electrically transmitted images, while the next details a forgotten nineteenth century dime novel author, or legislation on the regulation of wireless signaling.  Though these topics seem very disparate to us today, they emerged as part of the same epistemological endeavor.  Ordering the essays chronologically allows us to preserve this context.

A thematic index will provide a further entry point for readers interested in particular aspects of Gernsback’s thinking. Each of these five sections (which will organize the book's introductory essay as well) are explained below.

## Scientifiction 

> *Foundational writings on science fiction as a distinct genre, including literary historical essays on writers Gernsback understood to be predecessors: Wells, Verne, Poe, Luis Senarens, Clement Fezandié.*

Today, the phrase "science fiction" conjures up images of bug-eyed monsters, ray guns, starships, and sonic screwdrivers. But in the opening decades of the twentieth century, before a century’s accretion of images, narratives, and clichés, that which was not yet called science fiction consisted of a great number of concrete practices all geared toward a reckoning with the technological revolutions in the fabric of everyday life. "Science," wrote Gernsback in the inaugural issue of *Amazing Stories*,

> through its various branches of mechanics, astronomy, etc., enters so intimately into all our lives today, and we are so much immersed in this science, that we have become rather prone to take new inventions and discoveries for granted. Our entire mode of living has been changed with the present progress, and it is little wonder, therefore, that many fantastic situations [...] are brought about today. It is in these situations that the new romancers find their great inspiration. ("A New Sort of Magazine")

As early as 1915, Gernsback cites dime novels like *Deadwood Dick* and authors like Luis Senarens ("An American Jules Verne"), revealing an awareness of the genealogy of science fiction over a decade before the launch of *Amazing Stories* in 1926, when most SF critics locate the birth of the genre.  These essays make clear that a very sophisticated understanding of the genre's roots was already in place by the 1910s, and that science fiction as we understand it today was a rich and variegated series of activities, rather than merely a literary form.

## Tinkering and technology

> *Reports on broadcast experiments at Gernsback's WRNY radio station, new inventions developed at the Electro Importing Company labs, and critical essays on techniques for thinking creatively through technology.*

Gernsback oversaw experiments with broadcast media and the effects of various instruments and signal processing techniques on the auditory perception of the station's listeners from his radio station WRNY.  Several articles and editorials cover these experiments, including some of the earliest electronic instruments ("The Pianorad") and one of the earliest television broadcasts on record, using a unique method of interleaving audio and visual signals across a single frequency ("").

While conducting these groundbreaking experiments, Gernsback kept these developments opening to the contributions and participation of his readers.  In one editorial for *Radio News*, ("") Gernsback describes the television as just a simple add-on or expansion kit to a normal domestic radio set.  “I am quite certain [he writes] that the final television apparatus on your radio set will take up no more room than your present cone speaker.”

Regardless of how advanced the devices detailed in the pages of Gernsback’s magazines seemed—solar cells, automobile mounted radiotelephones, electric keyboards powered by vacuum tubes—his staff reported on them as if they only required a combination of already existing electrical principles and components.  These new media appear as little more than the sum of individual building blocks that one can pick and choose from out of the pages of the *Electro Importing Catalog*.

In one editorial for *Radio News*, Gernsback describes the television as just an add-on or expansion kit to a normal domestic radio set. "I am quite certain, for one, that the final television apparatus on your radio set will take up no more room than your present cone speaker."  

Though this goes on record as one of the earliest public television broadcasts, the Nipkow disk model was by that time decidedly low tech compared to the cathode ray tubes being pioneered by Philo Farnsworth and Vladimir Zworyin. ? [1] Keith Massie and Stephen D. Perry, "Hugo Gernsback and Radio Magazines: An Influential Intersection in Broadcast History," Journal of Radio Studies (vol. 8 no. 2, 2002), 277.

Rather, he had an abiding interest in the aesthetics of broadcasting audio, which he experimented with at his radio station WRNY, broadcasting concerts of electric keyboards in 1924 and remarking that the instrument’s notes "have practically no overtones," or reporting on experiments with the lower and upper limits of human hearing in "audio-frequency oscillator" experiments, for instance.[1] ? [1] Hugo Gernsback, "The Pianorad," Radio News (vol. 8, no. 5, November 1926), 493.

Texts highlighting the creativity of the inventor, techniques for problem solving. ("Is Radio at a Standstill?"; "Why the Radio Set Builder"; 

## Media history

> *Later works that read current inventions in light of their not so distant precursors, profiling forgotten (and often quirky) paths not taken in the development of radio and television.*

In Gernsback’s editorials, media history is evoked not merely as a nostalgic trip back to the devices of yesteryear, as it often is today in retro-kitsch, but as an archive of possibilities ripe for future experimentation. For instance, in a 1927 editorial "Radio Steps Out," at a moment when national broadcast networks were flickering to life and music and variety programs were flooding the country, the medium of radio had become a fixed idea in people’s minds that papered over the inherent abilities of the underlying technology. Looking back on that strange trajectory in which the technology underlying wireless telegraphy became "radio," an everyday part of household furniture, Gernsback writes, "the public at large is not aware of the fact that the art of radio is used for hundreds of different purposes aside from broadcasting and telegraphy."

"There is hardly any industry today that cannot make use of radio instruments in some phase of its work."

Examples range from a force-field like burglar alarm, to automating the recording of lightning strikes, from measuring the minute weight and touch of a fly to scanning factory workers for stolen metals. And, in a forgotten example of Gernsback’s own from the 1900s (which he christened the "Dynamophone," electric motors can be started remotely by the human voice, proving that "the apparatus foreshadowed broadcasting: the human voice actually did create effects at the receiving end," both for machines and humans.

Gernsback reminds us that the inherent abilities of wireless, of information transmitted through the air, has now itself been scattered by the winds of technological evolution and inflects our understanding of and interaction with a fantastic number of techniques, technologies, and media.

## Broadcast regulation

> *Activism, community organization, and manifestos written in service of radio amateur rights after the US government banned all public wireless activities in the wake of World War I; includes later writings for the technocracy movement.*

With the outbreak of World War I, the U.S. Navy took over all broadcast

forming "The Radio League of America"

As Tim Wu argues, Radio News even served as one of the first broadcast programming guides in the country’s history, publishing lists of each radio station in operation, along with their frequencies and "what one might expect to hear on them - a forerunner of the once hugely profitable TV Guide" (39)

1910, Gernsback forms the Wireless Association of America, "a pioneer organization through which he worked to thwart the U.S. Government and especially the U.S. Navy in their ’stupid short-sighted effort’ not to control amateur wireless but to impose wavelength restrictions that could have ruled it out of the air. Gernsback emerged as the single hero of the heroic fight to preserve amateur wireless. A thankful U.S. Navy appreciated this a few years later during World War I, when it suddenly needed thousands of wireless operators. They came mostly from the ranks of the Wireless Association of America which the Navy had tried to wreck." (autobio 39)

"The fact that Hugo Gernsback greatly affected the writing of the Wireless Act [of 1912] can be seen by comparing parts of his editorial from the February 1912 issue of Modern Electrics to the final contents of the act."

Gernsback led anti-Navy monopoly protests? Check it out in Barnouw? Also, Drown only gives part of this story: in a mere 5 or so years, RCA itself threatens becoming a corporate monopoly, hardly a good replacement for a federal one: "First regulated by the Radio Act of 1912, amateur radio was shut down by executive order for the duration of World War I on April 6, 1917. In 1918, the government began to consider legislation that would significantly reduce interference on the airwaves by giving a monopoly to the United States Navy. Amateur protest led by radio promoters Hiram Percy Maxim and Hugo Gernsback won a narrow band enclave on the short waves, but by the end of 1919, the Radio Corporation of America was formed after ’thorough discussion between Rear Admiral W.H.G. Bullard of the US Navy and Owen D. Young of General Electric’ (Barnouw, Tube of Plenty, 21). Established from the patents of General Electric, Westinghouse, ATandT and United Fruit, and presided over by General James G. Harbord, RCA would manage the business and technology of radio in the national interest." (54) @regulation

Kennedy: "With the war over, the question of "regulating the amateur" came up again. The 65th Congress proposed to amend the Alexander Wireless Bill, but the proposed amend- ments forbade so many things essential to-the amateur that the editor was moved to lampoon the bill in a bitter cartoon in the February 1919 Electvical Experimenter. The bill was killed. The hated demon had been effectively exorcised by the power of the cartoonist’s pen and of the printed word. The Acting Secretary of the Navy announced that, effec- tive April 15, 1919, all restrictions were removed on radio receiving stations other than those used for reception of commercial traffic."

1915 May – "Amateur Wireless Plants Closed By Government." anon. p. 28. http://earlyradiohistory.us/1915ban.htm A seemingly indiscriminate crackdown on amateur stations. From website: " During the first two-and-one-half years of the war the U.S. was officially neutral, and President Wilson assigned the U.S. Navy the task of insuring that U.S. radio stations respected this neutrality. Acting under this authority, for a few months the Navy banned all amateur sending and receiving in the west, as reported in Amateur Wireless Plants Closed By Government in the May, 1915 The Electrical Experimenter, although under the circumstances these restrictions appear to have been somewhat premature and excessive. (In his 1915 annual report, Victor Blue, Chief of the Navy’s Bureau of Navigation, noted that "in one naval district all amateur stations were closed... for a time sufficient to impress upon their owners the necessity for keeping the transmission of messages to a minimum.")"

Later association with the Technocracy movement. ("The Machine and the Depression")

## Selected fiction

> *Four short stories and the original serialized version of the famous *Ralph 124C 41+*, all of which have been out of print since their original magazine publication.*

While several editions of Gernsback’s *Ralph 124C 41+* was republished in 1950, 1958, and 2000, these are of a revised version Gernsback reran in 1929. The original, serial version from 1911 has not been seen since its original magazine print run. There are significant differences between these two versions of the novel that deserve to be looked at by a wider audience.

Other short stories by Gernsback that have not been reprinted include "New York A.D. 2660" (1911), "The Magnetic Storm" (1918), "The Electric Duel" (1923), and "The Killing Flash" (1929). As mentioned above, the speculative mode of these fictions is not out of step with the technical articles they were published alongside. Including them within the continuum of essays on broadcast regulation and tinkering allows them to be experienced in a context similar to their original intentions/publication.

# Specifications and Audience

Introduction, 12k - 16k? (40p typed, 30p in print / 53 typed, 40p in print)

Footnotes per essay?

80 essays, ranging from 500-2,500 words each, plus introduction and editorial apparatus, book would run ~100,000 words.

This volume has the potential for broad-based appeal to both academic and popular audiences.  A scant few works of scholarship have been devoted to this period in the history of science fiction, and it is my hope that the availability of these texts can significantly revise our understanding of the genre's origins.  Because Gernsback's writings explore many branching paths not taken in the history of media technologies, this book will be useful for media studies as well, a field increasingly interested in the "archaeology" of dead, hybrid, and imaginary media.  In design studies, where "design fiction" and "speculative design" are becoming vibrant fields of inquiry, a book surveying the prehistory of rapid prototyping and tinkering would prove a valuable resource.  These essays can find an audience outside of academia as well, as they were inherently meant to be read by a popular audience without sacrificing the sophistication of their ideas.

To offer you a sense of this material I have enclosed two sample articles, using a page layout mockup with wide footnote columns that can include (public domain) images and blueprints.  I have been in contact with members of Gernsback's family, who are very enthusiastic about this project and have assured me that the magazines and his writings remain in the public domain.  I have previously published on Gernsback in *Grey Room* and *Wi: Journal of Mobile Media,* as well as presented material from this book at Columbia, Princeton, the University of Pennsylvania, the Winterthur Museum of American material culture, and Université de Paris XIII, among other venues.

Drawing on extensive archival research from the collections at the Hugo Gernsback Papers at Syracuse University (research generously funded by the Princeton Program in American Studies), I propose a selected edition of roughly 80 essays ranging from 500 to 2,500 words each.  This edition, including editorial apparatus and footnotes, would run approximately 100,000 words.
