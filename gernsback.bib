@book{earle_re-covering_2009,
	Abstract = {In the first half of the twentieth century, modernist works appeared not only in obscure little magazines and books published by tiny exclusive presses but also in literary reprint magazines of the 1920s, tawdry pulp magazines of the 1930s, and lurid paperbacks of the 1940s. In his nuanced exploration of the publishing and marketing of modernist works, David M. Earle questions how and why modernist literature came to be viewed as the exclusive purview of a cultural elite given its availability in such popular forums. As he examines sensational and popular manifestations of modernism, as well as their reception by critics and readers, Earle provides a methodology for reconciling formerly separate or contradictory materialist, cultural, visual, and modernist approaches to avant-garde literature. Central to Earle's innovative approach is his consideration of the physical aspects of the books and magazines-covers, dust wrappers, illustrations, cost-which become texts in their own right. Richly illustrated and accessibly written, Earle's study shows that modernism emerged in a publishing ecosystem that was both richer and more complex than has been previously documented.},

@article{westfahl_jules_1992,
	Abstract = {By means of editorial comments and reprints of older works in Amazing Stories and other magazines, Hugo Gernsback was the first to present something resembling a history of {SF.} The earlier works he chose supposedly fit his na{\"\i}ve formula: a narrative incorporating scientific explanations and describing an imaginary but scientifically logical new invention or breakthrough. Gernsback saw the time before 1800 as a long period of relative inactivity, when potential authors of {SF} (Leonardo da Vinci, Roger Bacon) were hampered by the lack of a supportive environment and appropriate medium. Next, in the 19th century, several prescient writers (Poe, Verne, Wells, and others) emerged who dealt imaginatively with science in their works. Third, in the 20th century, the increased impact of science and a growing awareness of {SF-the} latter in part inspired by Gernsback himself-greatly enlarged the field and would eventually lead to even greater achievements. In letters to Amazing Stories, readers responded enthusiastically to Gernsback's history of {SF}, adopted its parameters, and added new authors. Gernsback's version of {SF} history also may have influenced, and is somewhat parallel to, later academic histories, with some noteworthy differences. Unfortunately, Gernsback's unfair payment policies tended to alienate writers, contributing to the demise of his {SF} magazines, harming his reputation, and obscuring his own importance in the history of {SF.}},

@article{westfahl_evolution_1996,
	Abstract = {Hugo Gernsback's influential novel {"Ralph} {124C} 41+" first appeared as a twelve-part serial in Gernsback's Modern Electrics, otherwise a newsy magazine for inventors. The 1911-12 text is essentially two different stories: the first seven installments are a placid travel tale about Ralph's future utopian Earth; the last five installments feature more scientific facts and are a melodramatic, at times horrific, space adventure involving pursuit of two villains, three violent deaths, and revival of a corpse. The shifts to space and an emphasis on scientific education were inspired by Mark Wicks' To Mars via the Moon, reviewed in a 1911 issue of Modern Electrics, while the shift to melodrama reflected other popular fiction of the time. The 1911-12 text also had passionate romantic passages that were later shortened and toned down because Gernsback thought they were ridiculous, as shown by his parodies of Ralph published in the magazine. Revising the text for 1925 book publication, Gernsback added six new chapters, worked to better integrate the two parts of his story by including foreshadowing elements in earlier chapters, tried to make information-conveying conversations more plausible, added passages of satire, developed the contrasting characters of his two villains, and occasionally improved its prose. The 1929 Amazing Stories Quarterly version, edited by T. {O'Conor} Sloane, made no substantive changes but at times weakened its logic and worsened its prose style. For the 1950 Second Edition, Gernsback made minor changes to update its contents and improve its prose. The 1958 paperback edition, anonymously copyedited, removed all diagrams, slightly shortened the text, and modernized the prose in several places. A text that straddles traditional boundary lines in science fiction-science/literature, thinking/dreaming, utopia/dystopia-Ralph also encapsulates the modern history of science fiction, first beginning with travel tale and utopia, shifting to melodrama and Gothic horror, and finally striving to integrate those elements with the added genre of satire.},
